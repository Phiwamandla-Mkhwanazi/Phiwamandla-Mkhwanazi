👨‍💻 Who Am I?
An indomitable full-stack developer thriving at the intersection of backend logic and frontend finesse—always chasing that sweet spot where functionality meets elegance.

My journey began with C—raw, powerful, and close to the metal. It felt like wielding ancient magic. But I didn’t stop there. I’ve since embraced tools and frameworks that make development more expressive, maintainable, and scalable.

On the frontend, React is home. With JSX, Tailwind CSS, and Vite, I unlock the full power of modern web development—streamlining both build and debug processes. React is the frontend for me. That said, I appreciate the elegance of minimalism: Lit for lightweight Web Components, and Redux when I crave that functional purity. Best part? React plays nicely with both.

On the backend, Java is my daily brew ☕—a language I truly resonate with. It’s reliable, powerful, and incredibly versatile, especially for embedded projects like those on Raspberry Pi. Kotlin may be calling from the horizon, but Java still delivers—without compromise.

Unexpectedly, I ventured into the Salesforce ecosystem. What began with Trailhead modules turned into a deeper understanding of the cloud, CRM architecture, and multitenancy. I now build with Apex, LWC, and JavaScript, and I've come to admire how the platform empowers both developers and non-developers alike.
