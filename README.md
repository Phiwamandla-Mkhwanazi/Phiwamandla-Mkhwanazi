As a dedicated Computer Science graduate with a strong foundation in back-end technologies, I have focused my academic and practical experience on mastering languages such as C and C#, delving into complex algorithms, and navigating the intricacies of the Debian operating system. My journey in software development has been driven by a commitment to depth over breadth, ensuring that I am proficient in the areas I concentrated on during my studies.

However, recognizing the importance of a well-rounded skill set in today's tech landscape, I sought to bridge the gap in my knowledge by enrolling in one of the leading bootcamps for front-end development. This decision has allowed me to enhance my capabilities in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks, thereby addressing my initial weaknesses and evolving into a more versatile developer.

My career goals are centered around becoming a full-stack developer who can seamlessly integrate back-end robustness with intuitive and dynamic front-end interfaces. I am passionate about continuous learning and am currently expanding my expertise in software engineering principles to stay ahead in this ever-evolving field. My journey is one of ongoing growth, and I am eager to contribute to innovative projects that leverage my comprehensive skill set to deliver impactful solutions.
